# Pokémon Ga-Olé in Java
Final Project for OOP Final(Java)
Worked with a team to design and code the Game (Pokemon GaOle)

This project recreates the **Pokémon Ga-Olé** arcade-style game using Java, showcasing the implementation of object-oriented programming principles in game development. Pokémon Ga-Olé is a dynamic, turn-based strategy game where players capture and battle Pokémon in an engaging virtual environment.

### Key Features:
- **Pokémon Mechanics**: Players can battle wild Pokémon, strategize moves, and capture them.
- **Turn-Based Combat**: Each player action, including attacks and item usage, dynamically updates the game state.
- **Data-Driven Design**: Pokémon stats, abilities, and moves are managed using modular and extensible data structures.

### OOP Highlights:
- **Encapsulation**: Game objects like Pokémon, battles, and items are self-contained for maintainability.
- **Inheritance**: Common traits of Pokémon (e.g., elemental types and move sets) are shared using a base class and specialized subclasses.
- **Composition**: Game scenarios aggregate objects like players, Pokémon, and environments to create dynamic gameplay.

This project addresses challenges such as balancing combat mechanics and creating a responsive UI. It serves as a foundation for further enhancements like multiplayer capabilities or integration of a database to manage Pokémon collections.
